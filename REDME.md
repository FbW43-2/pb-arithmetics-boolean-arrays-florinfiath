<!-- Exercise 1 -->

Declare two variables "snackServings" and "guests" and assign them number values.

Add snackServings and guests.

Subtract guests from snackServings. Then, subtract snackServings from guests.

Multiply snackServings and guests.

Divide snackServings by guests.

Declare another variable "drinks" with value "10". Multiply snackServings and guests. Then, divide the result by drinks. Store the result in a new variable named "resultOne". Print "resultOne" to the console.

Declare two variables: "monkeys" with value 15, and "bananas" with value 9. Divide monkeys by bananas.

Declare another variable "monkeyfights" with value 20. Add monkeys and bananas, then multiply the result by monkeyfights. Store the result in variable "resultTwo". Print "resultTwo" to the console.

Increment monkeys.

Decrement bananas.
